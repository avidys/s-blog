This is my first blog post using SvelteKit and Markdown. Here's what you can do with this blog system:

- Write posts in Markdown
- Add front matter for metadata
- Automatically generate post listings
- View individual posts with nice formatting

## Code Example

```javascript
console.log('Hello, World!');
```

## Next Steps

Feel free to add more posts by creating new `.md` files in the `src/posts` directory!
